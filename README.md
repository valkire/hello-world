Hello World

This is the history section. I once road a bicycle through the Sawtooth primitive area before the concept of a "mountain bike" existed. Although I no longer support cycling in primitive areas, at the time I believe I was the first to make this kind of trip through this area, and we tried to be very careful with our impact on the environment.
